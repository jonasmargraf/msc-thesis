Results interpretation




Reiterate aims / questions of work



Most important results



Strenghts / weaknesses of the work

node vector count: 4 corners have tons of samples

4 outliers are the 4 corners

node vector count without FNP: clustering around edges

Reference grounded theory?

Special mention:

Incomprehensible Map Organization

Some recognize areas of similarity, but the overall impression is that of a

reference missing inter-rater reliability,
potential bias in evaluation results

subjective coding

better feature model for perceived similarity of sounds
