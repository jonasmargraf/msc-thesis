\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
This chapter contains the results of our search for an optimal \gls{som} for the
\textit{Drum Essentials} sample library and the findings of the conducted user
interviews.

\subsection{SOM Metrics}
\label{subsec:results_som_metrics}
\textit{SOM Browser} exposes several variables of the algorithm, offering the
user influence over the resulting \gls{som}. The following sections show the
effects of these different user-controllable parameters on the metrics outlined
in Section \ref{subsec:eval_som_metrics}.
We then compare the three different learning rate factor approaches that were
implemented, including a differentiation between different magnification control
values for the BDH (see Section \ref{para:alpha_bdh}).
Finally, an ideal set of parameters for the selected sound corpus is chosen and
the resulting map is presented.
This map is then also calculated using our \gls{fnp} algorithm
extension introduced in \ref{subsubsec:som_forced_population} and the results
compared.

\smallskip

Ideally, we'd like the map shown in \textit{SOM Browser} to have one
or two vectors per node (meaning each map square only represents one or two
sounds) and no empty nodes. We therefore chose a map size of
$32 \times 32 = 1024$ as it is the closest square number to 1081, the number
of samples contained in our chosen corpus.

\subsubsection{Effects of Training Duration}
\label{subsubsec:som_training_effects}
The influence of training duration on the quality of the produced map can be
seen in Figure \ref{fig:som_training_effects}. As duration increases, all
metrics improve. As can be seen in the boxplot diagram, the distribution of
quantization errors narrows in on the median with longer training as well.

\smallskip

A practical consideration to be noted is that training duration
directly impacts processing time. For our measurements, which were run on a
fairly recent consumer laptop, training for $10^4$ steps took on the order of
minutes, while training for $10^5$ steps finished in about 30 minutes, and
the training for $10^6$ steps had to be run over night, as it took several
hours. Because of these practical considerations, which we assume to reflect
the needs of potential users of the software, all following maps were trained
for $10^4$ steps.

  \label{fig:som_training_effects}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Effects of $\alpha_{initial}$}
\label{subsubsec:som_alpha_effects}
The effect of the choice of $\alpha_{initial}$, the starting value for the
"gain control" of the node adjustment in response to each vector during
training, is shown in Figure \ref{fig:som_alpha_effects}.
Higher $\alpha_{initial}$ values yield slightly better results on quantization
errors, but don't improve vector node counts or map emptiness. Although this
effect does not appear to be dramatic, it is in line with \citet{kohonen1990},
who suggests a starting value of $\alpha = 0.9$. We therefore choose
$\alpha_{initial} = 0.9$ for the next maps.

  $r_{start} = 6.4$, $r_{end} = 1$}

\subsubsection{Effects of Radius Size}
\label{subsubsec:som_radius_effects}
Next, we examine the effects of the neighborhood function radius (Figures
\ref{fig:som_rStart_effects} and \ref{fig:som_rEnd_effects}). This kernel
function, which controls how far around the best matching unit nodes will be
adjusted during each training step, decreases from a starting value $r_{start}$
to a final value $r_{end}$. \citet{kohonen1990} recommends starting with a
rather large radius and ending with a value of one unit. This recommendation
does coincide with our measurements, which obtained best results when using a
narrow starting kernel radius of $r_{start} = 2$ that decreases to
$r_{end} = 10^{-1}$. It should be noted that although we achieved the best
results with $r_{start} = 2$, we used $r_{start} = 16$ for the comparison of
$r_{end}$ values in order to avoid a kernel that increases in size as training
progresses.

\subsubsection{Learning Rate Type Comparison}
\label{subsubsec:som_learning_rate_comparison}
There are three different approaches to the learning rate factor $\alpha$ that
are implemented in \textit{SOM Browser}: linearly decreasing, reciprocally
decreasing ("Inverse"), and the local adaptive learning rate as proposed by
\citet{bauer1996} ("BDH"). Differences between these are shown in Figure
\ref{fig:som_learning_rate_comparison} and Table
\ref{table:som_learning_rate_comparison}. While "Inverse" shows worse results
than "Linear", improvements can be seen when using BDH.

\bigskip

BDH offers another parameter, $m$, that can be controlled. \citet{bauer1996}
suggest values of $m = -1$, $-0.5$ or $-0.25$. We separately measured the
effects of values for $m$ of $[1.0, 0.9, \dots, -0.9, -1.0]$, the results for
which can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:som_BDH_m_comparison}. Interestingly,
median quantization errors, mean vector node counts and map emptiness all reach
a minimum at $m = 0$, which effectively results in a constant learning rate of
$\alpha = \alpha_{initial}$, as the adaptive local learning term of the BDH
equation equals 1 when $m = 0$ (see Section \ref{para:alpha_bdh}).
At the same time, the distribution of errors increases for positive values of
$m$ and is generally larger than for $m < 0$. In order to strike a balance
between a small median quantization error and a narrow error distribution,
$m = -0.2$ was chosen for the final map.

\subsubsection{Final Map and Influence of \gls{fnp}}
\label{subsubsec:results_final_fnp}
Based on the results presented above, a final map for the
\textit{Drum Essentials} sound corpus was created with the parameters
$\texttt{mapSize} = 32\times32$, training duration $ = 10^4$ steps,
$\alpha_{initial} = 0.9$, BDH learning rate factor, $m = -0.2$, $r_{start} = 2$,
and $r_{end} = 0.1$. A second map was calculated using the same parameters,
but also using the \gls{fnp} algorithm extension we developed. Comparisons
of the map with and without \gls{fnp} are shown in Table
\ref{table:som_fnp_comparison} and Figures \ref{fig:som_fnp_comparison} and
\ref{fig:results_fnp_comparison}. It can be seen that while \gls{fnp} introduces
more distortion into the map (indicated by higher quantization errors), it does
improve both mean vector node counts and map emptiness.

\subsection{Interview Results}
\label{subsec:results_interview}
Following the presentation of an optimal set of parameters for
\textit{SOM Browser} to display the \textit{Drum Essentials} corpus, the rest
of this chapter is dedicated to the results of the conducted user interviews,
whose design is explained in Section \ref{subsec:evaluation_interviews}.

\bigskip

The group of interview subjects consisted of one woman and four men with an
average age of 36 years and an average 15 years of experience in the audio
industry. Subjects described their profession as one or several of the
following: composer, producer, DJ, performer, sound / mixing engineer, sound
designer.

\bigskip

Subject responses to the ratings questions described in Section
\ref{subsubsec:questions_used} can be found in Figure \ref{fig:results_ratings}.

Recordings of the conducted interviews were transcribed by the author. These
transcriptions were examined for instances relating to the interview questions
and the relevant instances marked and subsequently coded using an
\textit{emergent coding} approach \citep[p.304]{lazar2017}. These codes are
presented here using matrix data displays (\citet[p.254]{saldana2015},
\citet{henwood2003}).

\subsubsection{Established Workflow Responses}
\label{subsubsec:results_established_workflow}
Sections 1 and 2 of the interview questionnaire inquire about subjects' current
workflow practices. Recorded responses are grouped into the categories
\textit{Description} (see Table \ref{table:current_workflow_description}) and
\textit{Assessment} (see Table \ref{table:current_workflow_assessment}). A
flowchart of established workflow practices was extracted from these responses
and is displayed in Figure \ref{fig:results_current_workflow}.

    "quickly go through the sounds while the track is playing and then find
    one that kind of fits"
    &
    The ability to audition sounds in the \textbf{context} of the relevant
    project is important.
    \\
    \textbf{Iteration}
    &
    "I will have like eight different kick drums [...] and then I go through
    them again as another iteration of choice."
    &
    Subjects will select a variety of samples as potential candidates and then
    perform another search among the selected subset.
    \\
    \textbf{Frustration}
    &
    "it takes a lot of time actually and it's not the most fun part"
    &
    Looking through lists of samples sequentially is perceived to cause
    \textbf{frustration}.

\subsubsection{SOM Browser Responses}
\label{subsubsec:results_som-browser_responses}
The third and largest section of the questionnaire assesses subjects' first
impressions of the \textit{SOM Browser} software. Responses varied between
individual subjects, but can generally be grouped into \textit{positive} and
\textit{negative} statements. These are presented in Tables
\ref{table:responses_som-browser_positive} and
\ref{table:responses_som-browser_negative}. Notable \textit{positive} responses
were prompted by the \textbf{visual design} of the software, as well as the
creative potential for using the software as an \textbf{instrument} because of
the \textbf{gestural interaction} it facilitates. Looking at participants'
 \textit{negative} responses, the organization of the map interface was seen as
 \textbf{incomprehensible}, with subjects not able to directly discern an
 overarching order, which in turn let to some questioning of the app's
 \textbf{usefulness} in its current state.

\subsubsection{Workflow Comparison: SOM Browser vs. Established Workflow}
\label{subsubsec:workflow_comparison}
Response codes concerning the comparison of \textit{SOM Browser} and established
workflows are shown in Table \ref{table:responses_workflow_comparison}. Subjects
stated a clear preference for their established workflows, but remarked upon the
\textbf{potential} of the software, particularly if it could be presented as an
\textbf{optional workflow} that integrates with existing production environments
(something that is echoed in the feature requests in Section
\ref{subsubsec:feature_requests}).

    \textbf{Preference for Established Workflow}
    &
    "I wouldn't want to miss my old way of looking for stuff."
    &
    Subjects state a preference for their established way of working with
    samples.
    \\
    \textbf{Optional Workflow}
    &
    "I would go for the traditional and just be presented with this like [an]
    alternative"
    &
    Subjects would like to incorporate \textit{SOM Browser} into their workflow
    if it was well-integrated into their existing tools and could be used as an
    alternative view mode.
    \\
    \textbf{Potential}
    &
    "I could imagine, that this if you use it a bit and you get used to it,
    yeah, it could make things faster actually"
    &
    The potential for certain workflow improvements such as increased speed and
    removal of alphabetical bias is acknowledged.

\subsubsection{SOM Browser: Feature Requests}
\label{subsubsec:feature_requests}
Lastly, subjects were asked what changes and additions they would like to see in
the presented software. These responses can be found in Table
\ref{table:responses_feature_requests}. Two particularly noteworthy responses
were the desire for \textbf{\gls{daw} integration} of the functionality of
\textit{SOM Browser} and the ability to navigate the map using
\textbf{Arrow keys}.

    \hline
    \textbf{Code} & \textbf{Example} & \textbf{Summary} \\
    \hline
    \textbf{\gls{daw} Integration}
    &
    "I would really like to see it as a plug-in or inserted in the production
    environment that I have. I would definitely not use, it if it's a
    standalone thing."
    &
    Subjects want to \textbf{integrate} the functionality of
    \textit{SOM Browser} into their established production environment, either
    in plug-in form or directly within the \gls{daw}.
    \\
    \textbf{Arrow Key Navigation}
    &
    "You need the arrows."
    &
    The need for granular map navigation using the keyboard's
    \textbf{Arrow keys} was mentioned repeatedly by subjects.
    \\
    \textbf{User-Definable Map Organization}
    &
    "be able to choose what each axis is"
    &
    The ability to more explicitly control how maps are organized.
    \\
    \textbf{Pre-Categorization}
    &
    "a pre-categorization would be nice"
    &
    Subjects express the wish to incorporate some sort of
    \textbf{categorization} to precede map calculation into the software.
    \\
    \textbf{File Limit}
    &
    "it’s about limiting the squares"
    &
    Subjects would like to \textbf{limit} the total number of files that can be
    displayed on a map. By preventing larger maps, the interface would
    potentially become less overwhelming.
    \\
    \textbf{Multi-Page Maps}
    &
    "[...] something that’s like a page based. Like, you go through the folders
    or you just type in quickly, just give here all the kicks or only all the
    snares"
    &
    Larger sample libraries could be spread out across several \textbf{pages},
    potentially based on the previously mentioned \textbf{pre-categorization}.
    \\
    \textbf{Feature Filters}
    &
    "[If] I'm looking for a sample that [...] is very short, then you
    would have to be able to filter this somehow"
    &
    Incorporate the option to \textbf{filter} samples on the map based on
    certain feature values or ranges.
    \\
    \textbf{Color Coding}
    &
    "all the dark and bass heavy stuff [...] in another color than [...] all the
    tsh-tsh-tsh stuff [makes high frequency noises]"
    &
    Introduce \textbf{color} as an additional dimension to display information
    about the files on the map.
    \\
    \textbf{Touchscreen Support}
    &
    "Only if it's like on a touchscreen"
    &
    Support for \textit{SOM Browser} on \textbf{touchscreen} devices.
    \\
    \textbf{Color Customization}
    &
    "maybe people can choose their colors"
    &
    Give users the option to \textbf{customize} interface \textbf{colors}.
    \\
    \textbf{Sample Retriggering}
    &
    "when I'm on a square I need a way to retrigger"
    &
    Ability to trigger the same sample repeatedly without clicking multiple
    times (presumably by pressing the Spacebar).
    \\
    \textbf{Larger Font Size}
    &
    "the letters [need] to be a bit more prominent"
    &
    Increase font sizes across the interface.
