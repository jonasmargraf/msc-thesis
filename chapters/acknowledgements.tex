I would like to express my gratitude to the advisors of this thesis, Prof. Dr.
Stefan Weinzierl and Dr. Diemo Schwarz for supporting my work. I am particularly
grateful to Diemo Schwarz for allowing me to work with him at IRCAM, where the
idea for all of this was born.

\bigskip
\noindent
I would also like to extend my thanks to Dr. Jochen Steffens for his help in
looking over my interview design and to Henrik von Coler for many helpful
conversations and tips on how to navigate the process of writing this thesis.

\bigskip
\noindent
Additionally, I wish to thank Jelle Akkerman for letting me bug him about
software architecture and sharing his coding expertise.

\bigskip
\noindent
None of this would have been possible without my parents and their continuous
support, even though finishing this degree has taken a bit of time. I am deeply
grateful for you.

\bigskip
\noindent
Thank you also to my sister Lena, for your empathy as you share my scholastic
woes.

\bigskip
\noindent
Finally, Audri, thank you for always being there. Here's to whatever comes next.
